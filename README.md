text translation tool inspired by this tutorial
https://youtu.be/6ynTcNH68bA?si=XFA4wXSt1yiCe6oq

The original tutorial had it done in all one text file, this allows you to have multiple text files

By placing translation csv files inside of lang and the csv file name as a line inside languages.txt
you can easily make seperate translations for different text in your game
